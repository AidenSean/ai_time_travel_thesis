# Temporal Intelligence: AI & Closed Timelike Curves

This repository contains a theoretical thesis exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, General Relativity, and Quantum Mechanics in the context of Time Travel.

## Abstract
Biological entities face insurmountable thermodynamic barriers to time travel (entropy reversal, memory erasure). This thesis argues that **Artificial Intelligence**—specifically Quantum AI—is the unique candidate capable of creating, stabilizing, and traversing Closed Timelike Curves (CTCs).

## Contents
- **[Thesis.md](Thesis.md)**: The full scientific argument and literature review.

## Key Concepts
- **QNN Stabilization**: Using AI to stabilize wormhole metrics limits in real-time.
- **Entropic Decoupling**: How Quantum Error Correction allows AI to retain memory effectively "outside" the causal loop.
